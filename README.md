# Async/Await Tasks

This project demonstrates the use of async/await in JavaScript through various tasks. Each task is implemented in a separate script for clarity.

## Tasks Implemented
1. **Task 01: Iterating with Async/Await**
   - Logs array values with a 1-second delay between each log.

2. **Task 03: Handling Errors with Async/Await**
   - Simulates an API call and handles errors gracefully with a user-friendly message.

3. **Task 05: Awaiting Parallel Calls**
   - Fetches data from multiple URLs concurrently using `Promise.all()`.

## How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Open the developer console to see the output.

## Example Outputs
- **Task 01**: Logs "A", "B", "C", "D" with a 1-second interval.
- **Task 03**: Logs either success data or an error message.
- **Task 05**: Logs responses from multiple URLs.

## Technologies
- JavaScript (Async/Await)
- HTML/CSS
